Your approach of using large language models (LLMs) purely as feature extractors is absolutely valid for comparing how well they capture semantics (in tasks like LaRoSeDa sentiment classification). You’re doing two main things:

Extract embeddings for each sample (by pooling the model’s hidden states).

Train a lightweight classifier (MLP) on top to see which LLM’s features yield the best downstream performance.

That’s perfectly fine for a research/benchmark project!

Below are a few practical suggestions and things to watch out for, specifically with LLaMA and other decoder-only (causal) models:

1. Using Causal LLMs as “Sentence Embedders”
Pros
You stay consistent across all models by using the same pooling logic.

It can work decently if you apply mean-pooling or more advanced “prompt engineering” to extract embeddings.

Cons
Unlike BERT-like encoders (which often have a dedicated [CLS] token), a causal LLM (e.g. LLaMA) is not explicitly trained to produce a single “sentence embedding.”

The resulting vector might not be as specialized for classification tasks.

That said, your fair comparison approach is valid: each model is used the same way, so results are comparable.

2. Memory / Performance Gotchas
Quantization / Offloading
LLaMA-3.1 8B is huge for an 8GB GPU. You need:

torch_dtype=torch.float16 AND

load_in_4bit=True

Possibly device_map="auto"

This is in your code, so that’s good.

Watch system RAM usage if you see your process get killed.

Avoid Full FP32
You’ll almost certainly OOM with 8 GB VRAM.

Time / Speed
If you’re extracting embeddings for thousands of samples, LLaMA-8B will be slow. Make sure to measure or at least factor this into your plan.

3. Pooling Strategies to Try
Your plan to compare last-token, mean pooling, prompt-based summarization is great. In practice, many LLM-based embedding methods do something like:

Mean Pooling:
mean_pooled
=
1
∑
mask
∑
(
ℎ
𝑖
𝑑
𝑑
𝑒
𝑛
_
𝑠
𝑡
𝑎
𝑡
𝑒
𝑠
×
𝑚
𝑎
𝑠
𝑘
)
mean_pooled= 
∑mask
1
​
 ∑(hidden_states×mask)

Max Pooling:
max_pooled
=
max
⁡
(
ℎ
𝑖
𝑑
𝑑
𝑒
𝑛
_
𝑠
𝑡
𝑎
𝑡
𝑒
𝑠
×
𝑚
𝑎
𝑠
𝑘
)
max_pooled=max(hidden_states×mask)

Prompt-based:
E.g. “This text: {TEXT} can be summarized in one sentence: [LLM output].” Then embed that output. Or “In one word, {TEXT} means: [LLM output].”

The difference in performance can be surprising, so it’s worth systematically testing them.

4. Specialized vs. General LLM Embeddings
Models like mGPT-1.3B or LLmic 3B might have had some Romanian data, but not necessarily as well-tuned for “universal sentence embeddings.” That’s okay for your experiment. Just note that bigger model size ≠ automatically better embeddings.

If you ever need the best cross-lingual embeddings quickly, you could compare with a known encoder approach like [sentence-transformers or E5-models], but that might be out of scope if you specifically want to compare Romanian LLMs.

5. Implementation Details to Double-Check
Ensure each LLM is loaded with the same device/offloading strategy – so you’re comparing apples to apples.

Check hidden dimensionality. In your code, you assume the embedding is dim=2560 for every model. Make sure each LLM’s hidden size actually matches that (or dynamically detect shape).

Save intermediate embeddings (which you already do in TitleContentDataset) to avoid re-running the LLM. Smart usage of save_interval is good.

6. Analysis & Visualization
T-SNE / UMAP on the embeddings is a great idea. It lets you visually see if positive/negative classes cluster in different regions.

Show not just accuracy but also F1 / confusion matrix if you have unbalanced classes.

Optionally measure inference time (seconds per sample) or GPU memory usage. It’s valuable to see if one model is huge but only marginally better.

7. Summary: Is Your Approach “Good Enough”?
Yes, for a research experiment that compares different Romanian LLMs as feature extractors:

You’re consistent: same pooling method across all models.

You’re training the same MLP on top of those embeddings for classification.

You’re testing standard tasks (like LaRoSeDa sentiment).

Any changes?

You’re mostly good. Just ensure each big model is quantized/offloaded properly (like you did with load_in_4bit=True) to avoid out-of-memory.

Consider exploring a prompt-based embedding if you have time.

Make sure you handle each model’s embedding dimension carefully.

Final Take
Your design is solid for a comparative study. Keep going, and remember to:

Track memory/time usage.

Possibly try more advanced prompts for embedding.

Compare a smaller specialized model (like a sentence-transformers in Romanian, if available) as a baseline.

Good luck with the experiments!
